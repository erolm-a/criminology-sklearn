Collected data on both present mentality and aggregated personality data is used to gauge the probability of that citizen committing a crime, the rating referred to as that citizen's Psycho-Pass. Authorities are alerted whenever excessive ratings are detected, and officers of the Public Safety Bureau are dispatched with weapons called \"Dominators\", energy pistols that modulate their power in response to the target's Psycho Pass.</blockquote> (*Abridged from Wikipedia*)"
